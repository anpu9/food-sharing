Project Description: This project is aimed at implementing various features using Redis as the underlying technology. It covers functionalities like SMS login, merchant query caching, coupon seckill, nearby merchants, UV statistics, user check-ins, friend followings, and expert store exploration. Each feature utilizes different Redis data structures and concepts to achieve its objective.

## Features

1. SMS Login
   - Description: Allows users to log in using SMS verification.
   - Implementation: Redis shared session is used to maintain user session data.

2. Merchant Query Caching
   - Description: Implements caching mechanism for merchant queries.
   - Concepts Covered: Caching techniques, cache penetration, cache breakdown, cache avalanche.
   - Implementation: Demonstrates practical scenarios related to caching concepts using Redis.

3. Coupon Seckill
   - Description: Provides coupon seckill functionality.
   - Concepts Covered: Redis counters, high-performance Redis operations with Lua scripts, Redis distributed locks, Redis message queues.
   - Implementation: Utilizes Redis counters and Lua scripting for efficient coupon seckill operations. Implements distributed locks and message queues with Redis.

4. Nearby Merchants
   - Description: Enables searching for nearby merchants based on geographic coordinates.
   - Concepts Covered: GEOHash in Redis for geospatial operations.
   - Implementation: Utilizes Redis GEOHash to perform geospatial operations and find nearby merchants.

5. UV Statistics
   - Description: Performs user visit (UV) statistics.
   - Implementation: Utilizes Redis for efficient tracking and counting of unique user visits.

6. User Check-Ins
   - Description: Implements user check-in functionality.
   - Concepts Covered: Redis BitMap data structure.
   - Implementation: Uses Redis BitMap to store and analyze user check-in data efficiently.

7. Friend Followings
   - Description: Implements friend following functionality.
   - Concepts Covered: Set operations for following, unfollowing, and common followings.
   - Implementation: Utilizes Redis Set data structure to manage friend followings.

8. Expert Store Exploration
   - Description: Provides functionalities related to expert store exploration.
   - Concepts Covered: List operations for managing like lists, SortedSet operations for leaderboard functionalities.
   - Implementation: Uses Redis List to manage like lists and SortedSet to implement leaderboard functionalities.
